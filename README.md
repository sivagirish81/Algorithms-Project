1.Quick sort with different type of partitions

2.We have n units of a resource to be allocated to r projects. n and r are integers and resource allocation is in integer units only. If j, 0<=j<=n, units of the resource are allocated to project i, then the resulting net profit is P (i,j). Design an algorithm to allocate the resource to the r projects so as to maximize the total net profit. Analyze its time complexity.

3.There is a line of 2n counters with no spaces between adjacent counters. The counters alternate between black and white: B W B W . . . B W. The objective is to rearrange the counters so that all the white counters are before all the black ones with no gaps between the counters: WW. . .WBB. . . B. The counters are to be moved in pairs; on each move, a pair of adjacent counters can be moved, without changing their order, into a vacant location. Design an algorithm that solves the problem in n moves for any n â‰¥ 3.

4. There are 4 women who want to cross a bridge. They all begin on the same side. You have 17 minutes to get all of them across to the other side. It is night. There is one flashlight. A maximum of two people can cross at one time. Any party who crosses, either 1 or 2 people, must have the flashlight with them. The flashlight must be walked back and forth, it cannot be thrown, etc. Each woman walks at a different speed. A pair must walk together at the rate of the slower woman. Crossing times taken by the 4 women are 1, 2, 5, and 10 minutes.
