Question 1:
	-We have n units of a resource to be allocated to r projects. n and r are
integers and resource allocation is in integer units only. If j, 0<=j<=n, units of
the resource are allocated to project i, then the resulting net profit is P (i,j).
Design an algorithm to allocate the resource to the r projects so as to
maximize the total net profit. Analyze its time complexity.

Execution instructions:
-Go to folder Solution_1 (open terminal in current folder and execute cd Solution_1)
-Run Resource_Allocation.py.
-Enter the input file names as Input or Inputx.
-Where x varies from 1 to 8
-If you wish to enter any input files then you must create your own input file inside the input directory.
-Pass the name of the file only as the input to the program.
-eg:File name->Input1.txt
-Input to program is Input1

Question 2:
	-There is a line of 2n counters with no spaces between adjacent counters. The
counters alternate between black and white: B W B W . . . B W. The objective
is to rearrange the counters so that all the white counters are before all the
black ones with no gaps between the counters: WW. . .WBB. . . B. The
counters are to be moved in pairs; on each move, a pair of adjacent counters
can be moved, without changing their order, into a vacant location. Design an
algorithm that solves the problem in n moves for any n â‰¥ 3.


Execution instructions:
-Go to folder Solution_2 (open terminal in current folder and execute cd Solution_2)
-Run the following commands:
	make -f makefile.mk
	./a.out
	n          							//value of n (greater than or equal to three)

Question 3:
	-There are 4 women who want to cross a bridge. They all begin on the same
side. You have 17 minutes to get all of them across to the other side. It is
night. There is one flashlight. A maximum of two people can cross at one time.
Any party who crosses, either 1 or 2 people, must have the flashlight with
them. The flashlight must be walked back and forth, it cannot be thrown, etc.
Each woman walks at a different speed. A pair must walk together at the rate
of the slower woman. Crossing times taken by the 4 women are 1, 2, 5, 1nd
10 minutes.

Execution instructions:
-Go to folder Solution_3 (open terminal in current folder and execute cd Solution_3)
-Run the following commands:
	make -f makefile.mk
	./a.out

Question 4:
	-Analyze quick sort for various methods of partitioning.

Solution_4
-Open Input Folder and use Input_Generator.py to create a new input file.
-You have 4 optionns-:
	+Generate inputs of any size ,give a file name and your input is generated in the appropriate file in a random order.
	+Generate inputs of any size ,give a file name and your input is generated in the appropriate file in Ascending order.
	+Generate inputs of any size ,give a file name and your input is generated in the appropriate file in descending order.
	+Create your own input mentioning size.

Execution instructions:
-Go to folder Solution_4 (open terminal in current folder and execute cd Solution_4)
-Once you generate the input run Sort.c
-Give the input as Input/InputFilename.txt
-Your Output file name for each method of partitioning as Output/OutputFileName.txt
-OutputFile consists of sorted elements and time taken for execution.
-First output file name is for Lomuto partition.
-Second Output file name is for Lomuto partition with randomized pivot.
-Third Output file name is for Hoare partition with randomized pivot.
